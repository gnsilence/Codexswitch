## [v0.1.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- Added a Codex sessions page that inspects session metadata by provider, shows session/index distribution, and migrates historical sessions to the CodexSwitch-managed provider.
- Added provider enable/disable controls so disabled channels stay visible in the UI but are skipped by request routing.
- Added upstream resilience settings for circuit breaker thresholds, recovery probe delays, outbound HTTP version, and connection timeout.
- Added Responses WebSocket proxy support for providers that expose the OpenAI Responses websocket flow.
- Added Claude bootstrap config handling so the installer and startup path can seed `.claude` settings automatically.
- Added bundled macOS app icon and dock integration for the refreshed desktop shell.

### Changed

- Reworked Codex and Claude config writers to preserve user-authored settings, keep originals as same-name `.bak` backups, and restore from those backups on exit.
- Reworked proxy forwarding to fail over across enabled providers on transient upstream failures while preserving non-retryable authentication and request errors.
- Refreshed icon resolution and caching to prefer bundled Codex, Claude, and Xiaomi assets with theme-aware defaults.
- Updated the desktop shell, provider dialogs, home/models/providers/settings pages, and localized copy for the new UI pass.

## [v0.0.11] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- Corrected release metadata so the published tag, assembly version, file version, informational version, changelog entry, and installer artifact names align on `v0.0.11`.

## [v0.0.9] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Added a subtle fade/slide transition when Codex table content changes.
- Widened the pinned table side columns so longer labels fit more comfortably.

## [v0.0.8] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Refactored usage log table from CodexPinnedTable to CodexTable for simplified layout and improved maintainability.
- Updated CodexSwitchUI submodule with latest UI component improvements.

### Fixed

- Stabilized macOS DMG packaging with staging directory and retry logic to prevent transient resource-busy errors on macOS 14 runners.

## [v0.0.7] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- Added a Home dashboard with live proxy and provider summary cards, range-scoped usage metrics, token and cost trend charts, and provider/model ranked breakdowns.
- Added built-in Codex OAuth account enrichment and multi-account management, including ChatGPT workspace resolution, plan and quota snapshots, and usage-query support per enabled OAuth account.
- Added output tokens-per-second and page navigation to the local usage log table.

### Changed

- Restructured the desktop shell around the new sidebar and home layout, and moved version/update status into the lower-left footer.
- Updated the Codex OAuth provider template to use the current Codex client headers and request overrides.
- Removed the repo `global.json` SDK pin so local builds follow the installed .NET SDK.

### Fixed

- Normalized OpenAI Chat replay so tool outputs stay immediately after assistant tool calls and unmatched tool calls are dropped before proxying upstream.
- Restored Codex OAuth provider defaults and account metadata consistently during config migration and refresh flows.
- Matched Electron-style macOS packaging by always building `.app`/`.dmg` release artifacts without requiring Developer ID signing or notarization.
- Made macOS DMG creation use a staging directory with retries so macOS 14 runners do not fail on transient `hdiutil` resource-busy errors.

## [v0.0.6] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added Anthropic Messages compatibility for OpenAI Chat and OpenAI Responses providers, including non-streaming and streaming conversion for messages, tool use, reasoning output, and usage accounting.
- Added a separate hover details window for the mini status panel while keeping the compact usage strip pinned in place.
- Added richer button variants, pressed/hover states, focus-visible styling, icon sizing, and danger styles.

### Changed

- Switched the built-in DeepSeek template and migration path back to the OpenAI-compatible Chat API while keeping Claude Code support enabled.
- Updated Claude Code proxy settings to write the proxy root URL instead of appending `/v1`.
- Made Windows release packaging prefer `iscc` from `PATH` and handle runners without `ProgramFiles(x86)`.

### Fixed

- Automatically enable Claude Code support when a provider is switched to the Anthropic Messages protocol.
- Signed, notarized, and Gatekeeper-validated macOS release DMGs when Apple release credentials are configured.

## [v0.0.5] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- Added outbound network proxy settings with system proxy, custom proxy, and disabled proxy modes.
- Added a shared HTTP client factory that defaults to the system proxy, prefers HTTP/2, keeps pooled connections alive, and enables HTTP/2 keep-alive pings.
- Added Claude Code provider settings that write and restore `~/.claude/settings.json`, expose provider/model controls, and route `/v1/messages` through CodexSwitch.
- Added Claude Code `sonnet`, `opus`, and `haiku` aliases for Anthropic providers, including optional 1M context handling for Sonnet models.
- Added manual Claude Code model entry with quick model buttons and preserved Anthropic extension headers when proxying `/v1/messages`.

### Changed

- Optimized the local Codex to CodexSwitch proxy listener for low-latency keep-alive connections with TCP no-delay, longer client keep-alive, disabled response buffering, and higher connection limits.
- Split active provider selection for Codex and Claude Code so the local proxy can serve either client and migrate legacy provider configs safely.
- Recreate shared networking services when proxy settings change so provider adapters, OAuth, usage queries, icon loading, and update checks use the latest network configuration.
- Moved proxy request usage logging to buffered background writes and coalesced concurrent OAuth token refreshes to reduce request-path latency.
- Bounded cached Responses conversation state with capacity and TTL pruning to prevent unbounded memory growth.

- Automated GitHub Release publishing from tagged CI runs with write-scoped release permissions.
